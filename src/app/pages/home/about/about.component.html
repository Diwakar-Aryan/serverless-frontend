      <p>
        When the first human stretched out a tentative hand to touch a
        fossilized stone, a petrified log or a daub of terra, the first
        impression was made.
        <br />
        <br />Around the object of expression grew the print tradition. And to
        the tradition man brought his best gifts: the work of his hands in arts
        and crafts, the ingenuity of his mind in techniques and, the harmony of
        communities in sharing.

        Wabisabi Project explores and harvests these gifts in the hand block
        printing tradition using only natural dyes. Our mission is to inspire
        consumers to value and appreciate the genuineness of collective

        By finding and re-cultivating the seeds of collective wisdom. We rely on
        the age-old process of good conversations. With in-house design and
        product development, Wabisabi Project enables traditional artisans’
        knowledge, designers and on-ground researchers to have dialogues. As we
        talk together, we are able to then create products that resonate the
        shared history of the tradition.
