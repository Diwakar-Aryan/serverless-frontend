        At our block printing and natural dye unit in Bagru, Rajasthan; we are
        not only re-making Jajam in its traditional form but also adapting the
        classic motifs and patterns into our contemporary collection of home
        furnishings. Each of our fabric has gone through various steps of
        indigenous way of pre-treatment to ensure a good color absorption
        capacity and longevity of the fabric.

        Like Jajam textiles, the collection showcases red and black – two
        elusive colors, made from alizarin and iron filings respectively.
