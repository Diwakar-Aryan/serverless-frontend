        In the pre-industrial era, India’s prolific textile industry was
        virtually clothing the world.

        The exceptional proficiency of Indian craftsmen was representative of a
        unique heritage of creative talent that was specific to their world
        view. Rooted to their surrounding raw materials and commune of patrons
        and audiences, their peculiar characteristic of hereditary practices
        over ages evolved and later enabled them to adapt to the changes in
        demand of new markets far away from home.
