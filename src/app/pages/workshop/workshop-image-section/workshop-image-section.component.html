      <p>
        Tell us your preferred dates and we will organise a workshop for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        We never really crowd up our workshops with too many people. We keep a
        threshold of 3-4 participants. Our experience is that more interactions
        with people with similar interests during the workshop enhances learning
        for all the participants.
