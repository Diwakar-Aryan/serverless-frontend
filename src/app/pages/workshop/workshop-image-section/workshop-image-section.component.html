    <h2>At Your Schedule</h2>
    <p>Tell us your preferred dates and we will organise a workshop for you.</p>
    <p>
      We never really crowd up our workshops with too many people. We keep a
      threshold of 3-4 participants. Our experience is that more interactions
      with people with similar interests during the workshop enhances learning
      for all the participants.
